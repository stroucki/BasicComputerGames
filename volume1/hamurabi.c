// David Ahl's note:
// This program was originally written in Focal at DEC; author unknown.
// David Ahl converted it to BASIC and added the 10-year performance
// accessment. If you wish to change any of the factors, the extensive
// remarks in the program should make modification fairly straightforward.
// Note for trivia buffs: Somewhere along the line an m was dropped out of
// the spelling of Hammurabi in the Ahl version of the computer program.
// This error has spread far and wide until a generation of students
// who have used this program now think that Hammurabi is the incorrect
// spelling.

// Porter's note:
// The particular impetus to port this game came from a side discussion
// held at Demosplash 2017 at Carnegie-Mellon University 
// in Pittsburgh PA US.
